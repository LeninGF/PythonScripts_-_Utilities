In this example we use *main.py* as de the principal script which imports the funcion *print_my_name* from the script *hello.py*

In order to use the import, the scripts to be used as a source for functions must be in root folder. It can be the case that the script calling the functions inside another python script can be i another folder. If you move hello.py inside the same PythonFunctions_Import Folder,things will not work for 


## Saving console output:
- python main.py | tee hola_screent.txt
- python main.py > hola_screen.txt
